# Introduction {-}
We have seen so far how to work with data. Performing analysis of what has happened allows us to take a determined action to change the course of a business. However, we can also use this data to predict.

Predictive analysis is a technique that every Data Scientist must master, and _Machine learning_ provides us with robust algorithms to be able to make predictions.

_Machine learning_ is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. Applications range from data mining programs that discover general rules in large datasets, to information filtering systems that automatically learn user interests [@mitchell1997]. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. _Machine learning_ algorithms create a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

A good _data scientist_ knows how to build prediction algorithms using _machine learning_. In the following chapters, we will see techniques both for discrete variables and for when we work with continuous variables from the two main machine learning approaches: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"ML.png"))
```

Keep in mind that there are also other approaches, such as semi-supervised learning or **reinforcement learning** where the algorithm learns from a real or synthetic environment. These approaches will not be covered in this book, which focuses on the most commonly used approaches for starting out as a _data scientist_.
