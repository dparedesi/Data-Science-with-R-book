# (PART) Statistics {-}

# Introduction to Probabilities {-}
Understanding probability theory is indispensable for every Data Scientist.

In the following chapters we are going to learn how to apply probability theory in R. It is expected that the reader has basic knowledge in statistics given that we will not go into depth in each of the statistical concepts.

For example, we are not going to explain formulas for calculating probabilities of independent or dependent events. Instead, we are going to apply directly probabilities of independent or dependent events in R.

# Discrete Probabilities
We will start with some basic principles of categorical data. Probabilities of this type are called discrete probabilities. Understanding the basic principles of discrete probabilities will help us understand continuous probabilities which are the most common in data science applications.

Recall that a discrete variable is a variable that cannot take some values within a minimum countable set, that is, it does not accept any value, only those that belong to the set.

For example, if we have 4 women and 6 men seated in a room and we were to raffle 1 prize, intuitively we would know that the probability that the winner is a man is 60%.

## Calculation using the mathematical definition
The probability we obtained by intuition in the previous example can be expressed as follows:

$P(A) = probability\ of\ event\ A = \frac{Times\ event\ A\ can\ occur}{Total\ possible\ outcomes}$

$P(Winner\ is\ man) = \frac{6}{10} = 60\%$

## Monte Carlo Simulation for Discrete Variables
Monte Carlo simulation or method is a statistical method used to solve complex mathematical problems through the generation of random variables. In this case the problem is not complex, but Monte Carlo can be used to familiarize ourselves with a method that we will use constantly.

We will use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the proportion we would obtain if we repeated this experiment randomly a determined number of times. That is, the probability of the event using this estimation would be the proportion of times that event occurred in our simulation.

In R we can easily create random samples using the `sample()` function. For example, let's create a vector of students and then use the `sample()` function to choose one at random.

```{r eval=FALSE}
students <- c("woman", "woman", "woman", "woman", "man", 
                 "man", "man", "man", "man", "man")

sample(students, 1)
```

We could also use the `rep()` function to create the `students` vector faster. To do this we would enter as the first argument a vector and as the second another vector indicating how many times we want them to be created. Thus, we would create the students vector faster.

```{r eval=TRUE}
students <- rep(c("woman", "man"), times = c(4, 6))

students
```

Now we have to simulate a determined number of times the experiment of picking a random element. For this we will use the `replicate()` function. Let's replicate this experiment 100 times:

```{r eval=TRUE}
students <- rep(c("woman", "man"), times = c(4, 6))

n_times <- 100

results <- replicate(n_times, {
  sample(students, 1)
  })

results

```

We can see what the result was for each of the 100 draws we simulated.

Now we will use the `table()` function to transform our `results` vector into a summary table that shows us how many times each value appeared.

```{r eval=TRUE}
table(results)
```

If we store this result in a vector `tabla_results`, we can then use the `prop.table()` function to know the proportion of each value:

```{r eval=TRUE}
tabla_results <- table(results)

prop.table(tabla_results)
```

We should not worry if the probability that it is a man has not come out exactly 60%. Recall that we are estimating the probability using a method that depends on the number of times we simulate the experiment. The more times we repeat the experiment the closer we will be to the value. For example, let's replicate this experiment now 10,000 times.

```{r eval=TRUE}
students <- rep(c("woman", "man"), times = c(4, 6))

n_times <- 10000

results <- replicate(n_times, {
  
  sample(students, 1)

  })

tabla_results <- table(results)

prop.table(tabla_results)

```

We see how the value converges to 60%. We should not worry if the value varies by a few digits from the one presented in this book given that we are simulating a random event.

Finally, for this simple example we could also have used the `mean()` function. Although this calculates the average of a set of numbers, we could convert our `students` vector to numerical values, where each value is converted to 1 or 0 depending on some condition.

To do this, R makes the conversion of vectors to 1 and 0 very simple using the comparator operator `==`:

```{r eval=TRUE}
students == "man"
```

When we apply the `mean()` function to this result, it coerces `TRUE` values to `1` and `FALSE` values to `0`. Thus, if we apply the average of this list, we would have the percentage of men and with it the probability that when choosing a person it is a man:

```{r eval=TRUE}
mean(students == "man")
```

### Other functions to create vectors 
We have already learned the `rep()` function to create vectors faster. Another function we find in R is the `expand.grid(x, y)` function which creates a data frame of all combinations between vectors `x` and `y`.

```{r eval=TRUE}
greetings <- c("Hola", "Chau")
names_list <- c("Andrés", "Josep", "Alonso", "Andrés", "Cesar", "Jeremy")

result <- expand.grid(saludo = greetings, nombre = names_list)
result
```

Finally, we have the `paste(x,y)` function, which concatenates two strings or vectors of strings adding a space in the middle.
```{r eval=TRUE}
paste(result$saludo, result$nombre)
```

Thus, we can easily generate, for example, a deck of cards distributed in 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs. The cards of each suit are numbered from 1 to 10, where 1 is the Ace, and followed by Jack, Queen, and King.

To do this, we would have to create a vector of suits and a vector of numbers to then create the combinationl and have the complete deck.

```{r eval=TRUE}
numbers <- c("Ace", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", 
             "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King")
suits <- c("of Hearts", "of Diamonds", "of Spades", "of Clubs")

# Create card combinations
combination <- expand.grid(numero = numbers, palo = suits)

# Concatenate vectors to have our final combination
paste(combination$numero, combination$palo)
```

Once our deck is created we can inquire some probabilities easily with the created vector.

Let's calculate the probability that when choosing a card it is "King of Diamonds":
```{r eval=TRUE}
# Store the combinationl in the variable deck
deck <- paste(combination$numero, combination$palo)

mean(deck == "King of Diamonds")

```

Or we can also calculate the probability that when choosing a card it is some Queen:
```{r eval=TRUE}
# First create the vector of "Queen of..."
queens <- paste("Queen", suits)

# Probability calculation
mean(deck %in% queens)
```

`r if(params$hidden){"<!--"}`
## Exercises
`r ne`. Store in the variable `prob` the probability that when rolling a die you do **not** get the number 1. Using the variable `prob`, now calculate the probability that when rolling 3 times in a row, one after another, in none of those times the number 1 comes out.

```{r echo=FALSE}
inc(params$hidden, ne)
```

<details>
  <summary type="button">Solution</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
prob <- 5 / 6

prob * prob * prob
```
</details>

`r ne`. Given a container containing 5 blue marbles, 3 yellow, and 4 gray. What is the probability that if you choose a marble at random it is blue?

<div align="center">
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "200pt"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"probabilities-marbles.png"))
```
</div>

```{r echo=FALSE}
inc(params$hidden, ne)
```

<details>
  <summary type="button">Solution</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
marbles <- rep(c("blue", "yellow", "gray"), times = c(5, 3, 4))

# Solution using monte carlo simulation, repeating the event 10,000 times:
results <- replicate(10000, {
  
  sample(marbles, 1)
  
  })

prop.table(table(results))

# Solution using the `mean()` function:
mean(marbles == "blue")
```

Mathematically it would be:

Given the event: $X = chosen\ marble\ is\ blue$:

$P(X)=\frac{5}{5+3+4}=\frac{5}{12}=41.67\%$

The probability that the marble is blue is 41.67%.

</details>

`r ne`. What is the probability that when choosing a marble at random from the previous container it is **not** blue?

```{r echo=FALSE}
inc(params$hidden, ne)
```

<details>
  <summary type="button">Solution</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
marbles <- rep(c("blue", "yellow", "gray"), times = c(5, 3, 4))

mean(marbles != "blue")
```

The probability is 58.33%.

Mathematically it would be:

Given the event $X = chosen\ marble\ is\ blue$:

$P(\sim~X)=1-P(X)=1-\frac{5}{12}=1-41.67\%=58.33\%$

</details>

`r ne`. Now we are going to take out a marble first, place it outside the box and take out another additional marble from the box. What is the probability that the first one is blue and the second is **not** blue? This time, instead of creating the marble vector, create the numerical variables: blue, yellow and gray assigning as value the number of marbles. Then calculate mathematics probabilities.

```{r echo=FALSE}
inc(params$hidden, ne)
```

<details>
  <summary type="button">Solution</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create variables
blue <- 5
yellow <- 3
gray <- 4

# Calculate probability that the first marble is blue:
p_1 <- blue / (blue + yellow + gray)

# First calculate the probability that the second is blue:
p_aux <- (blue - 1) / (blue - 1 + yellow + gray)

# Calculate the complement because they ask that the second is NOT blue:
p_2 <- 1 - p_aux

# Calculate what is asked:
p_1 * p_2
```

This is called **sampling without replacement**. We have two events, we are taking out two marbles. The second event depends on the first. These two events are not independent of each other.

</details>

`r ne`. Now we will repeat the previous experiment, but after taking out the first marble we put it back in the box and take out one more marble at random. What is the probability that the first marble is blue and the second is **not** blue? Modify the R code you created previously to calculate this probability.

```{r echo=FALSE}
inc(params$hidden, ne)
```

<details>
  <summary type="button">Solution</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create variables
blue <- 5
yellow <- 3
gray <- 4

# Calculate probability that the first marble is blue:
p_1 <- blue / (blue + yellow + gray)

# First calculate the probability that the second is blue:
p_aux <- blue / (blue + yellow + gray)

# Calculate the complement because they ask that the second is NOT blue:
p_2 <- 1 - p_aux

# Calculate what is asked:
p_1 * p_2
```

This is called **sampling with replacement**. We have two events, we are taking out two marbles again. The second event does **not** depend on the first. These two events are independent.

</details>

`r if(params$hidden){"-->"}`

## Combinations and Permutations
Some probability situations involve multiple events. When one of the events affects others, they are called dependent events. For example, when objects are chosen from a list or group and are not returned, the first choice reduces the options for future choices.

There are two ways to order or combine results of dependent events. **Permutations** are groupings in which the order of objects matters. **Combinations** are groupings in which the content matters but the order does not.

For this we will use the `gtools` package, which includes libraries like `gtools` that provide us with intuitive functionalities to work with permutations and combinations.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# First install the gtools package
install.packages("gtools")

# To start using it, load the gtools library
library(gtools)

```

### Permutations
The order matters when we calculate, for example, the winners of a competition. Suppose we have 10 students who are competing on equal terms for who builds the most accurate machine learning model.

```{r eval=TRUE}
data_scientists <- c("Jenny", "Freddy", "Yasan", "Iver", "Pamela", "Alexandra", 
                     "Bladimir", "Enrique", "Karen", "Christiam")
```

Only the top 3 will receive the prize. In this case the order matters, so we will use the function `permutations(total, selection, data)` where `total` indicates the size of the vector, `selection` indicates the size of the result I want, and finally `data` is my source vector.

```{r eval=FALSE}
permutations(10, 3, v = data_scientists)

```

We have already calculated all possible results. We can calculate on this result the probability that Freddy wins the competition and that Pamela is in second place.

```{r eval=TRUE}
results <- permutations(10, 3, v = data_scientists)

# Total results: nrow(results)
total <- nrow(results)

# Probability that Freddy wins:
mean(results[, 1] == "Freddy" & results[, 2] == "Pamela")
```

### Combinations
The order does not matter when, for example, we form groups of 2 to participate in the competition.

```{r eval=FALSE}
combinations(10, 2, v = data_scientists)
```

If now only one team is going to win the prize, we could calculate the probability that the team made up of Pamela and Enrique are the ones who win.

```{r eval=TRUE}
results <- combinations(10, 2, v = data_scientists)

# Total results:
nrow(results)

# Probability:
mean((results[, 1] == "Pamela" & results[, 2] == "Enrique") | 
     (results[, 1] == "Enrique" & results[, 2] == "Pamela"))
```

Although we can obtain the probability by calculating all combinations, in R it will be very frequent to use Monte Carlo to estimate the probability by simulation. For the previous case we would not have to generate all combinations, but simply take a sample of two people who would be the members of the winning team. Recall that we have assumed that everyone has equal chances of winning.

```{r eval=FALSE}
sample(data_scientists, 2)
```

Then, we would have to replicate this experiment over and over again, store the sampling results and calculate the proportion of how many times the winning team was composed of Pamela and Enrique.

```{r eval=TRUE}
n <- 10000

resultado <- replicate(n, {
      equipo <- sample(data_scientists, 2)
      
      cumple_condicion <- (equipo[1] == "Pamela" & equipo[2] == "Enrique") | 
                          (equipo[2] == "Pamela" & equipo[1] == "Enrique")
      
      cumple_condicion
})

mean(resultado)
```

Note that, as we saw previously, the value converges as we increase the number of times we repeat the experiment `n`. We have simulated repeating the experiment 10 thousand times. However, how many times would it be necessary to replicate the experiment to trust the results of the simulation?

## Sufficient Experiments with Monte Carlo Simulation
Intuitively we can indicate that the greater the number of experiments the more precise the estimated probability. We can, thus, do several simulations with different number of experiments for each simulation. In this way we could find a reasonable number of experiments for our simulation. To do this, first we create a numerical vector where the number of times we are going to simulate the experiment is indicated. Our vector will contain the following values: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160,..., etc. This means that the first time we will simulate the experiment 10 times, the second 20 times and so on.

```{r eval=TRUE}
n_times <- 10*2^(1:17)
n_times
```

Then, we use the code we created to replicate the experiment to create a function called `probabilidad_por_muestra`:

```{r eval=TRUE}
probabilidad_por_muestra <- function(n) {
  resultado <- replicate(n, {
    equipo <- sample(data_scientists, 2)
    
    cumple_condicion <- (equipo[1] == "Pamela" & equipo[2] == "Enrique") | 
                        (equipo[2] == "Pamela" & equipo[1] == "Enrique")
    
    cumple_condicion
  })
  
  mean(resultado)
}
```

We already have a function that allows us to replicate the experiment as many times as we want. For example, in the previous section we simulated 10 thousand experiments. Now that we have created the function we would do:

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Probability using functions:
probabilidad_por_muestra(10000)
```

Again, this is a simulation. So every time we execute that function the probability will vary as it is a random sample.

To apply a function on each of the values of a vector we use the function `sapply(vector, function)` where `vector` is the vector where the data on which I want to apply the function is and `function` is the function I want to apply.

```{r eval=TRUE}
prob <- sapply(n_times, probabilidad_por_muestra)

prob
```

This gives us the probabilities depending on the number of times we repeat the experiment. Now let's place these results in a scatter plot to see how it converges

```{r eval=TRUE}
probabilities <- data.frame(
  n = n_times,
  probabilidad = prob
)

probabilities |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(n, probabilidad) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("# of times of the experiment")
```

We can also change the scale to zoom in on the probabilities for smaller experiment number values and add a reference line with the theoretical probability value calculated previously:

```{r eval=TRUE}
probabilities |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(n, probabilidad) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("# of times of the experiment") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.022222, color = "blue", lty = 2)

```

We observe that, for this experiment, repeating the experiment 10 thousand times (x-axis = 3 because it is $10^3$) already gives us a good approximation to the real value.

## Case: Birthdays in Classrooms
Let's review the concepts learned with another example. In a _Data Science for Managers_ class there are 50 students. Using Monte Carlo simulation, let's estimate what is the probability that there are at least two people who have birthdays on the same day. (Let's ignore those who have birthdays on February 29).

First let's list all the days of the year available for birthdays:

```{r eval=TRUE}
days <- 1:365
```

Let's generate a random sample of 50 numbers from the `days` vector, but this time with replacement because a person could have the same day, and store it in the `colleagues` variable.

```{r eval=TRUE}
colleagues <- sample(days, 50, replace = TRUE)
```

To validate if any of the values are repeated we will use the `duplicated()` function which validates if there are duplicate values within the vector:

```{r eval=TRUE}
duplicated(colleagues)
```

Finally, to determine if there was any `TRUE` value we use the `any()` function:
```{r eval=TRUE}
any(duplicated(colleagues))
```

The result tells us whether it is true or not that there are at least two people who have birthdays on the same day. To estimate by Monte Carlo simulation what the probability is, we have to repeat the experiment many times and take the proportion of how many times we get `TRUE` as a result.

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Monte Carlo simulation with 10 thousand repetitions
n_times <- 10000

results <- replicate(n_times, {    
    
    colleagues <- sample(days, 50, replace = TRUE)
    
    # Returns a logical value of whether there are duplicates
    any(duplicated(colleagues))
})

# Probability:
mean(results) 
```

We see that the estimated probability is very high, above 95%. What would happen if I have a room of 25 people?

To do this, we modify the previous code and create the variable `classroom` which will indicate the number of students in that class:

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Monte Carlo simulation with 10 thousand repetitions
n_times <- 10000
classroom <- 25

results <- replicate(n_times, {    # Returns a logical vector
    colleagues <- sample(days, classroom, replace = TRUE)
    any(duplicated(colleagues))
})

# Probability:
mean(results) 
```

Let's now create the function `estima_probabilidad` and estimate using this function the probability of finding at least two people with the same birthday in a room of 25 people. This time we have to specify that the sampling is with "replacement" because by default the `sample()` function is "without replacement".

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Create the function
estima_probabilidad <- function(classroom, n_times = 10000){
    results <- replicate(n_times, {    # Returns a logical vector
        colleagues <- sample(days, classroom, replace = TRUE)
        any(duplicated(colleagues))
    })

    # Probability:
    mean(results) 
}

estima_probabilidad(25)
```

Finally, if we already have a function that calculates based on the number of people in a room we can create a numerical vector with the total number of people from different rooms and then apply the function we have created. The result can be stored in the variable `prob`.

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Create 80 different classrooms
# The first room with 1 person, the last room with 80 people
classrooms <- 1:80

# Estimate probability depending on the number of students per room
prob <- sapply(classrooms, estima_probabilidad)

prob
```

Thus, if we place it in a scatter plot we can see how the probability increases as there are more students:

```{r eval=TRUE}
probabilities <- data.frame(
  n = classrooms,
  probabilidad = prob
)

probabilities |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(n, probabilidad) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Number of students in each class")
```

We can now impress our friends from different groups by telling them that, if they are in a room of 60 people, "you can bet them" that there are two people in that room who have birthdays on the same day. It is not definitive, but the chances are very much in our favor.

## Exercises

`r ne`. Two students of the _Data Science with R_ course, Alonso and Georgina, usually play chess in their free time. Given Georgina's experience, she has a 60% chance of winning every time she plays with Alonso. **Without using Monte Carlo simulation** What is the probability that when playing 4 times in a row, Alonso has won at least once.

  <summary type="button">Solution</summary>
  
Calculating the probability that Alonso has won at least once is the complement of the probability that Georgina has won all 4 times. Thus, we will first calculate the probability that Georgina has always won and then calculate the complement.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Probability that Georgina wins all 4 games
prob <- 0.6^4

# Probability that Alonso wins at least once
1 - prob

```
</details>

`r ne`. Estimate the previous probability using Monte Carlo simulation. Use the following code to generate a sample of 4 games, where Alonso has a 60% probability of losing to Georgina.

```{r eval=FALSE}
resultado_juegos <- sample(c("loses","wins"), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

## Integrative Exercise
Let's solve together this exercise that integrates everything we have learned in this chapter, called the Monty Hall problem.

### Monty Hall Problem
Monty Hall was a TV presenter who made famous a contest in his show which we are going to replicate below. We have three doors in front of us:

<div align="center">
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"monty-hall-cerradas.png"))
```
</div>

Behind one of these doors is a zero-kilometer car, while in the other two there is a goat. We, as contest participants, have to choose together which door to open. Whatever is behind it will be ours.

Suppose we have chosen door number 2. Once you announce our choice, Monty Hall tells us that he is going to help us and opens a door for us right now. He opens one of the other doors and it turns out there is a goat in door 3 that he opened.

<div align="center">
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"monty-hall-abierta.png"))
```
</div>

Monty Hall asks us: 

>I am going to give you a chance to change doors and that will be your final choice, Would you change doors or stick with the door chosen at the beginning?

Intuitively we knew that, when all doors were closed, the car is in one of 3 doors. The probability of winning would be $\frac{1}{3} = 0.3333$ so it didn't matter which door to choose. But when he opens door number three he gives us information and the first thing we should ask ourselves is whether the probabilities have been affected or not. Although this is an advanced math exercise using change of variable, we can execute a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probabilities and solve it without using almost any mathematical formula.

Let's start by simulating the experiment. At the beginning we had three doors, door 1, 2 and 3. We will create the variable `doors`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
doors <- c("door 1", "door 2", "door 3")
```

Then, we know that behind the doors there is a car and two goats distributed randomly. We will use the function `sample` to order them randomly.

```{r eval=FALSE}
prizes <- sample(c("car", "goat", "goat"))
```

Since Monty Hall knows where the prize is. We are going to create a variable `prize_door` where we will store where the car is.

```{r eval=FALSE}
prize_door <- doors[prizes == "car"]
```

Now we choose a door randomly and store our result in the variable `choice`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
choice <- sample(doors, 1)
```

Given that we already have the chosen door shown we will simulate Monty Hall choosing the door to open. Since he is the presenter he will choose any door that is not the door where the prize is or your door.

```{r eval=FALSE}
door_opened <- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(choice, prize_door)],1)
```

Finally, we are going to put all the code together and in the last line add the comparison of whether the prize door matches our choice. This time we are going to choose not to change doors, so our choice does not vary.

```{r eval=FALSE}
doors <- c("door 1", "door 2", "door 3")
prizes <- sample(c("car", "goat", "goat"))
prize_door <- doors[prizes == "car"]
choice <- sample(doors, 1)
door_opened <- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(choice, prize_door)],1)

choice == prize_door
```

With our experiment created we are going to simulate what would happen if we stick with the choice and what would happen if we change it.

#### Stick with the chosen door
Let's replicate about 10 thousand times to see the proportion of times we would win if we stick with our door.

```{r eval=TRUE}
n_times <- 10000

results <- replicate(n_times, {
      doors <- c("door 1", "door 2", "door 3")
      prizes <- sample(c("car", "goat", "goat"))
      prize_door <- doors[prizes == "car"]
      choice <- sample(doors, 1)
      door_opened <- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(choice, prize_door)],1)
      
      choice == prize_door
})

mean(results)
```

We see that the probability obtained by Monte Carlo simulation is an estimation very close to the probability that we had intuitively calculated. That is, if we keep our choice of the door we chose we have a 33.33% probability of winning.

But, what happens if we change doors? Is the probability of winning the same?

#### Change door
We are going to use the code and modify it by creating the variable `new_choice` to make the door change.

```{r eval=TRUE}
n_times <- 10000

results <- replicate(n_times, {
      doors <- c("door 1", "door 2", "door 3")
      prizes <- sample(c("car", "goat", "goat"))
      prize_door <- doors[prizes == "car"]
      choice <- sample(doors, 1)
      door_opened <- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(choice, prize_door)],1)
      
      new_choice <- doors[!doors %in% c(choice, door_opened)]
      
      new_choice == prize_door
})

mean(results)
```

As we see, changing the door in this show gave us a probability of 66.66% of winning, while keeping our choice only 33.33%.

It may sound counterintuitive, but statistically speaking it is better to change doors instead of trusting our luck and keeping the initial choice.
