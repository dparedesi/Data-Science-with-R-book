## Why R? {-}

R is a language created by statisticians for data analysis, making it an excellent choice for your data science journey. It is free and open-source, meaning there are no licensing costs and you can inspect how any function works under the hood. Its rich ecosystem includes over 19,000 packages on CRAN covering virtually any analytical task, from machine learning to bioinformatics. 

One of R's strongest features is reproducibility, allowing you to write scripts once and share them with colleagues to obtain consistent results anywhere. It also offers best-in-class visualization through ggplot2 for publication-quality graphics and Shiny for interactive dashboards. Furthermore, you will find an active community with extensive documentation, tutorials, and a welcoming presence on social media.

While Python is also popular in data science, R excels particularly in statistical analysis and data visualization. These are the core skills we will develop throughout this book, leveraging the tidyverse ecosystem to make data manipulation intuitive and readable.

## Installing R {-}

You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (**CRAN**).

1. Search for CRAN on Google:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Google search results page showing CRAN R Project download link"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "CRAN-google.png"))
```

2. On the CRAN page, select the version for your operating system—Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="CRAN homepage with download links for Linux, macOS, and Windows"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "CRAN-website.png"))
```

The following steps show the Windows installation process. The steps for Mac and Linux are similar—simply select your operating system and follow the corresponding download link.

3. On the CRAN website, click on `base` to download the core R installation. This includes all the basic packages you need to get started. Later chapters will show you how to install additional packages.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="CRAN Windows download page with base R installation link"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "CRAN-windows.png"))
```

4. Click on the download link to get the latest stable version:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="CRAN download link for latest R version installer"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "CRAN-64-bits.png"))
```

Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

**Installation Tip:** When the installer asks about options, the default settings work perfectly for beginners. You can always customize your installation later.
:::

## Installing RStudio {-}

Although you could start using R directly in the console, we recommend installing RStudio—an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes working with R significantly more productive and enjoyable.

1. Search for RStudio on Google:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Google search results for RStudio download"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio-google.png"))
```

2. You'll see the Posit website (RStudio's parent company). Click on **DOWNLOAD** in the upper right menu:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio website homepage with Download button in navigation"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio-website-0.png"))
```

3. Scroll down until you find the download options. Select the **Free** RStudio Desktop option:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio Desktop download options showing Free and Pro versions"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio-website-1.png"))
```

4. The page will display a download button optimized for your operating system. You can also choose from the list of all available installers below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio installer download button for current operating system"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio-website-2.png"))
```

Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the on-screen instructions.

::: {.rmdnote}
**Having trouble?** Installation issues are usually straightforward to resolve. Check the [CRAN FAQ](https://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html) or search "R installation [your OS]" for community solutions. The [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is also an excellent resource.
:::

## RStudio Sections {-}

When you start RStudio for the first time, you'll see three main sections:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Initial RStudio window showing three panels: console, environment, and files"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "VirtualBox_Windows-7-Enterprise_22_03_2018_16_21_16.png"))
```

One of the great advantages of R over point-and-click analysis software is that we can save our work as **Scripts**—text files containing R code that can be shared, version-controlled, and re-run at any time.

To create a new Script, click on **File → New File → R Script**:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio File menu expanded showing New File then R Script option"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "VirtualBox_Windows-7-Enterprise_22_03_2018_16_21_42.png"))
```

This opens the fourth panel, giving you the complete RStudio layout:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio interface with four panels: source editor, console, environment, and plots"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio.png"))
```

Let's understand the layout. The **Source Editor** in the top-left is where you write and edit your R scripts. Think of it as your code notebook where you can save, organize, and run code. Below it is the **Console** (bottom-left), where code executes and results appear. You can type commands directly here for quick experiments.

On the right side, the **Environment/History** panel (top-right) shows all variables and functions you have created in your current session, while the history tab tracks your commands. Finally, the **Files/Plots/Help** panel (bottom-right) serves multiple purposes, allowing you to browse files, view generated plots, and access package documentation.

### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts {-}

Mastering keyboard shortcuts will significantly speed up your workflow. The most commonly used command is running the current line or selection, which you can do by pressing `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter` on Mac). To run the entire script, use `Ctrl + Shift + S` (`Cmd + Shift + S`).

Creating a new script is as easy as pressing `Ctrl + Shift + N` (`Cmd + Shift + N`), and you should save your work frequently with `Ctrl + S` (`Cmd + S`). A shortcut specific to R is inserting the assignment operator (`<-`), which is done with `Alt + -` (`Option + -`). Finally, you can quickly comment or uncomment lines using `Ctrl + Shift + C` (`Cmd + Shift + C`).

::: {.rmdtip}
**Pro Tip:** Press `Alt + Shift + K` (Windows/Linux) or `Option + Shift + K` (Mac) in RStudio to see the complete list of keyboard shortcuts.
:::

## Testing Your Installation {-}

Let's verify everything is working correctly. Go to the Console panel and calculate how much 13 multiplied by 265 is. Click on the console, type the following, and press **Enter**:

```{r eval=TRUE}
13 * 265
```

You should see `3445` as the result. Let's understand the output format:

::: {.rmdnote}
**Understanding R Output:**

- The `[1]` before the result indicates this is the first element of the output. R can return multiple values, and the bracketed number helps you track which element you're looking at.
- In this book, we use `##` to distinguish R output from R code. Lines starting with `##` show what you'll see in your console after running the code.
:::

Now let's try something more interesting. R isn't just a calculator—it's a powerful tool for working with data. Try this in your console:

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Create a vector of values
values <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Calculate the mean
mean(values)

# How many elements are there?
length(values)
```

You've just created your first data structure (a vector) and applied functions to it—fundamental concepts we'll explore in depth in the next chapter.

### Writing Scripts {-}

While the console is great for quick experiments, scripts are essential for reproducible work. Try this in the **Source Editor** (not the console):

```{r eval=FALSE}
# My First R Script
# Calculating basic statistics

# Create some data
temperatures <- c(22, 25, 23, 28, 30, 27, 24)

# Calculate statistics
mean(temperatures)    # Average temperature
max(temperatures)     # Highest temperature
min(temperatures)     # Lowest temperature
```

To execute code from the script:

1. **Run a single line**: Place your cursor on the line and press `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter` on Mac)
2. **Run selected lines**: Highlight the lines you want to run and press `Ctrl + Enter`
3. **Run the entire script**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + S` (or `Cmd + Shift + S` on Mac)

Notice that lines starting with `#` are **comments**—R ignores them, but they're invaluable for explaining your code to others (and to your future self!).

::: {.rmdcaution}
**Challenge: Test Your Setup**

Try these exercises to confirm everything works:

1. Calculate `sqrt(144)` in the console (the square root of 144)
2. Create a new script with three different calculations and save it as `my_first_script.R`
3. Use the assignment operator (`<-`) to store a value: `my_number <- 42`
4. Print your stored value by typing `my_number` and pressing Enter
