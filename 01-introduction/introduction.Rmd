# Introduction {-}

Data science requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines statistics, programming, data mining, and business understanding. This book is designed to help you develop those skills through practical examples in R.

```

## Why R? {-}
R is a language created by statisticians for data analysis. Its versatility makes it a powerful tool for exploring, modeling, and visualizing data.

## Installing R {-}
You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (**CRAN**).

1. Search for CRAN on Google:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Google search results page showing CRAN R Project download link"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "CRAN-google.png"))
```

2. Once on the CRAN page, select the version for your operating system: Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="CRAN homepage with download links for Linux, macOS, and Windows"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "CRAN-website.png"))
```

Here the steps for Windows are shown, but the steps are similar for Linux or Mac OS X.

3. On the CRAN website, we need to install `base` which includes all the basic packages you need to get started. Later, in the following chapters, we will see how to install other additional packages.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="CRAN Windows download page with base R installation link"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "CRAN-windows.png"))
```

4. Click on the first link to get the most recent version:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="CRAN download link for latest R version installer"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "CRAN-64-bits.png"))
```

Then, open the installer you just downloaded to install R and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Installing RStudio {-}
Although you could already start using R in console mode, we are going to install RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE), which will facilitate our work with R.

1. Search for RStudio on Google:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Google search results for RStudio download"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio-google.png"))
```

2. You should see the website as it appears below. Once there, go to the upper right menu and click on **DOWNLOAD**

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio website homepage with Download button in navigation"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio-website-0.png"))
```

3. Then scroll down until you find the download options. Select the **Free** RStudio Desktop option.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio Desktop download options showing Free and Pro versions"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio-website-1.png"))
```

4. It will show you the button to download according to your operating system. You can also download from the list below the **Download** button.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio installer download button for current operating system"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio-website-2.png"))
```

Once the installer is downloaded, open it and follow the on-screen instructions.

## RStudio Sections {-}
When you start RStudio for the first time, you will see 3 sections:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Initial RStudio window showing three panels: console, environment, and files"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "VirtualBox_Windows-7-Enterprise_22_03_2018_16_21_16.png"))
```

One of the great advantages of R over point-and-click analysis software is that we can save our work as Scripts.

To create a new Script, you can click on File, then New File, and then on **R Script**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio File menu expanded showing New File then R Script option"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "VirtualBox_Windows-7-Enterprise_22_03_2018_16_21_42.png"))
```

This way we will have the 4 sections, or panels, of RStudio:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="RStudio interface with four panels: source editor, console, environment, and plots"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "01-introduction", "rstudio.png"))
```

* **Code editor**: The code editor for Scripts where we can save our Scripts.
* **R console**: The R **console** where we will see the result of the execution of our Scripts.
* **Environment/History**: Here we will mainly see the variables/functions as we create them.
* **Other panes**: Finally a section with additional tabs. Here we will see our created plots, for example.

## Testing RStudio {-}
To test that we have installed it correctly, go to the console section and calculate how much 13 multiplied by 265 is. Click on the **console section**, type in the console and then press **Enter**

```{r eval=TRUE}
13 * 265
```

You should have gotten `3445` as a result in the same way you observe lines above. With the difference of the symbol `##`. This symbol in this book will serve to differentiate the result that our R Scripts yield. Thus, if you do not see the symbol `##` it is R code, and what is with `##` simulates the result seen in the console.

You will also see before the number `3445` the number 1 in brackets: `[1]`. This is because each Script can yield a set of solutions/results. In brackets it tells you which solution number it shows you. In this case the solution is unique, but later we will see when there are more results from your Script.

You can get the same result if you write in the **Scripts section**, and not in the console, that will allow you to make several calculations. For example, on one hand I can do 28 * 27 and then I can calculate a sum 65 + 35

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Calculating 28 multiplied by 27:
28 * 27

#Adding 65 + 35:
65 + 35
```

To execute from the scripts section we can select all the lines and then click on **Run** in the upper right part or press **Ctrl** + **Enter**. Keep in mind that the `#` sign makes that line a comment.

Try selecting all the text, then selecting only the sum line and click on **Run**. You will see that it only executes what you select.

You are now ready to start learning R.
