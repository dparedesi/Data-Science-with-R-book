# Introduction {-}

We have seen so far how to work with data: importing, cleaning, and visualizing it. Performing analysis of what has happened allows us to take a determined action to change the course of a business. However, the true power of data science lies in using this data to **predict** the future.

Predictive analysis is a technique that every Data Scientist must master, and _Machine learning_ provides us with robust algorithms to make these predictions.

_Machine learning_ is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is a subset of artificial intelligence where algorithms create mathematical models based on sample data, known as "training data", to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Applications range from recommendation engines (like Netflix or Spotify) to fraud detection and self-driving cars [@mitchell1997].

A good _data scientist_ knows how to build prediction algorithms using _machine learning_. In this book, we will focus on the two main approaches:

We will explore two primary approaches to machine learning. **Supervised Learning** involves training models on labeled data where we know the correct answer, allowing us to predict outcomes for new, unseen data—either as numbers (regression) or categories (classification). In contrast, **Unsupervised Learning** deals with unlabeled data, where the goal is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings (clustering) without a pre-defined answer key.

```

Keep in mind that there are also other approaches, such as semi-supervised learning or **reinforcement learning** where the algorithm learns from a real or synthetic environment. These approaches will not be covered in this book, which focuses on the foundational techniques for starting out as a _data scientist_.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

In this chapter, we will learn to distinguish between **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning approaches. We will implement core algorithms such as **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest** for classification tasks, and build **regression models** to predict continuous variables. Additionally, we will evaluate model performance using essential metrics like **confusion matrices** and **ROC curves**, apply **clustering techniques** to segment data, and select the optimal model using the modern `tidymodels` framework.

## Chapter Structure

We will cover the two main approaches to machine learning:

Our journey covers these two fundamental pillars. We begin with **Supervised Learning**, focusing on models that learn from historical data to predict future outcomes, covering both classification and regression problems. We then move to **Unsupervised Learning**, techniques designed to find structure in unlabeled data, such as grouping similar customers or reducing complex datasets to their essential features.

Keep in mind that there are also other approaches, such as semi-supervised learning or **reinforcement learning** where the algorithm learns from a real or synthetic environment. These approaches will not be covered in this book, which focuses on the most commonly used approaches for starting out as a _data scientist_.
