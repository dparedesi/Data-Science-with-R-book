# (PART) Real Cases {-}

# Introduction {-}

Having mastered the fundamentals of R programming, data transformation, and visualization, it's time to put these skills into practice with real-world scenarios. The following case studies demonstrate end-to-end data science workflows that you might encounter in professional settings.

**In this chapter, you will:**

-   Connect R to external APIs (Google Analytics) for automated data retrieval.
-   Apply cleaning, transformation, and visualization to real estate market data.
-   Practice the full workflow: problem definition → data access → analysis → insights.

Each case introduces complementary libraries such as `googleAnalyticsR` for API access and `lubridate` for date manipulation, reinforcing patterns from earlier chapters while adding new practical tools.
