# Appendix A: Responsible AI Checklist {#ethics-checklist}

As we conclude this book, use this checklist before deploying any model or analysis to production.

## 1. Data Quality & lineage
- [ ] **Provenance:** Do I know exactly where this data came from?
- [ ] **Consent:** Was the data collected with consent? Does it contain PII?
- [ ] **Representation:** Does the training data match the real-world population it will be applied to?

## 2. Fairness & Bias
- [ ] **Protected Classes:** Have I checked performance across different groups (Gender, Age, Ethnicity)?
- [ ] **Proxy Variables:** Are there variables (like Zip Code) acting as proxies for protected classes?
- [ ] **Impact:** Who could be harmed if this model makes a mistake? (e.g., Denying a loan vs. Recommending a bad movie).

## 3. Transparency & Explainability
- [ ] **Documentation:** Is the model card created? (Inputs, Outputs, Limitations).
- [ ] **Explainability:** Can I explain to a non-technical stakeholder *why* the model made a specific prediction?
- [ ] **Feedback Loop:** Is there a mechanism for users to report errors or contest decisions?

## 4. GenAI Specifics
- [ ] **Fact-Checking:** Have I verified AI-generated code/facts against reliable sources?
- [ ] **Security:** Have I ensured no sensitive data is being sent to public APIs?
- [ ] **Attribution:** Am I transparent about which parts of the work were AI-generated?
