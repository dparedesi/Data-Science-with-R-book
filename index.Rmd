# Preface {-}

Welcome to the third edition of *Data Science with R*!

In an era where data-driven decisions shape industries from healthcare to finance, mastering R gives you the power to extract insights, build predictive models, and communicate findings effectively. This book has evolved from personal learning notes into a comprehensive resource that takes you from fundamentals to advanced data science techniques using practical, hands-on exercises.

This book is designed for beginners with no prior R experience who want a structured path into data science, as well as analysts looking to upgrade from spreadsheets to reproducible R workflows. It also serves students, professionals, and practitioners seeking to modernize their machine learning skills with tidymodels. Basic familiarity with statistics concepts is helpful but not required, as all code examples are self-contained and explained step-by-step.

The third edition reflects the latest developments in the R ecosystem. We have updated everything to run on R 4.5.2 and RStudio 2025.09.2. A major shift in this edition is the full migration to tidymodels for machine learning and the adoption of modern tidyverse patterns, including the native pipe operator. We have also introduced entirely new topics such as Generative AI and LLM integration with R, AI-assisted coding workflows, ethics in data science, and enhanced text mining. You will also find expanded content on interactive visualization, deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow, big data processing with Sparklyr, and reproducible workflows using Git and GitHub.

Each chapter builds on previous concepts, but you can also jump to topics of interest. If you are learning R from scratch, start with the Fundamentals in the first two chapters. Chapter 3 covers visualization with ggplot2, while Chapter 12 dives into building machine learning models. For those interested in working with Large Language Models, Chapter 14 covers Generative AI. Throughout the book, you will find hands-on exercises to test your understanding. Solutions are provided, but we encourage you to try them yourself first.

Just like previous editions, many exercises are inspired by practical classroom experiences and activities from the [Professional Certificate in Data Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science)^[https://online-learning.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science] by **HarvardX**. The code used to generate this book is available on GitHub, encouraging transparency and reproducibility.

# Acknowledgments {-}

## Family {-}

First and foremost, I want to express my profound gratitude to my wife, Desislava, for her invaluable emotional support during the countless hours I dedicated to this project. Her knowledge in R was also key—contributing solutions and perspectives that enriched this work.

## Mentors and Inspirations {-}

A special thanks to [Rafael Irizarry](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/rafael-a-irizarry/)^[https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/rafael-a-irizarry/], a true benchmark in the R world, whose didactic approach to teaching advanced techniques significantly advanced my learning. I also extend my gratitude to the developers who, with their dedication, continue to create and maintain this wonderful language.

My gratitude also goes to Briguit Reinaldo, CEO of Cedhinfo, whose tireless work brings the teaching of computer technologies to more people in Peru, inspiring many to explore new opportunities.

## Contributors {-}

Finally, I want to acknowledge the valuable contribution of engineering students from UNI who participated in grammatical review, paraphrasing, exercise creation, and topic proposals. Special thanks to [Josep Agama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josep-agama-749a61190/)^[https://www.linkedin.com/in/josep-agama-749a61190/] and [Andrés Espinoza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aespinozacontreras/)^[https://www.linkedin.com/in/aespinozacontreras/] for their fundamental contributions to the first three chapters.
